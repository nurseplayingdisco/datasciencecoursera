# datasciencecoursera
My first repo: part of the data scientist toolbox course on coursera.

I am a Swedish medical doctor working in immunological research, currently as a post doctoral fellow at Johns Hopkins University's Dept. of Oncology. My main research interests are stem cell transplantation and adoptive cell therapy.
